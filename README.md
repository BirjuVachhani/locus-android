Locus is a tiny kotlin library for android which makes it super very easy to retrieve location with just few lines of
code. Everything including permission model and Location settings resolution is handled internally which removes a lot
of boilerplate code any developer have to write every time.

### Documentation:

See [Wiki](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/wiki) for more information and configuration!

### Read blog here:

#### [The Legendary Task of Retrieving Location in Just 3 lines of code.](https://birju.dev/posts/retrieve-location-in-just-3-lines-android/)

## Features

* Android R support (Please report if any issue is found)
* Completely written in Kotlin
* Easy Initialization
* Handles Permission Model
* No Boilerplate
* Built on Kotlin DSL
* Manifest Permission Check
* Life-Cycle Aware Location Updates
* Location Settings Check
* Location Settings Request
* Custom Location Options Configuration
* Custom Rationale Dialog configuration
* Custom Permission Blocked Dialog configuration

## IMPORTANT:

### Breaking Changes from v4.0.0

> Text Customizations using `Locus.configure{}` block which were deprecated in `v3.2.0` have been now removed completely. This means `rationaleText`, `rationaleTitle`, `blockedTitle`, `blockedText`, `resolutionTitle`, and `resolutionText` no longer exist on `Locus.configure{}`. Migration would be to customize/override them from `strings.xml`.

#### Before

```kotlin
Locus.configure {
    rationaleTitle = "Rationale Title"
    rationaleTitle = "This is a rationale message."
    blockedTitle = "Permission Blocked Title"
    blockedText = "This is a permission blocked message."
    resolutionTitle = "Permission Resolution Title"
    resolutionText = "This is a permission resolution message."
}
```

#### Now

*strings.xml*

```xml
<string name="locus_rationale_title">Rationale Title</string>
<string name="locus_rationale_message">This is a rationale message.</string>
<string name="locus_permission_blocked_title">Permission Blocked Title</string>
<string name="locus_permission_blocked_message">This is a permission blocked message.</string>
<string name="locus_location_resolution_title">Permission Resolution Title</string>
<string name="locus_location_resolution_message">This is a permission resolution message.</string>
<string name="grant">Grant</string>
<string name="deny">Deny</string>
```

checkout [strings.xml](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).

### How to disable background location permission if you don't use it.

It has been brought to my attention recently that this library includes background location permission in its `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This could cause a problem when publishing app on Google Play Store in a case where your does not actually request or use background location. If that happens then this is what you need to do.

Just add this line in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file and you should be good to go.
```xml
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

Feel free to re-open [#53](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/issues/53) issue or file a new one if this does not work for you.

## Gradle Dependency

* Add the JitPack repository to your project's build.gradle file

        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

* Add the dependency in your app's build.gradle file

```
