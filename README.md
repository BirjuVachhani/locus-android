Locus is a tiny kotlin library for android which makes it super very easy to retrieve location with just few lines of
code. Everything including permission model and Location settings resolution is handled internally which removes a lot
of boilerplate code any developer have to write every time.

# Looking for Maintainers

Its been a long time since I moved away from native Android development so I am finding it hard to keep up with the latest changes with the location
permissions in newever Android versions and fix issues reported here. I'd love someone to actively maintain this library and look into the issues. If you are interested and up to the task, drop a mail at `brvachhani@gmail.com` or comment on [this issue](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/issues/74). Thanks!

### Documentation:

See [Wiki](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/wiki) for more information and configuration!

### Read blog here:

#### [The Legendary Task of Retrieving Location in Just 3 lines of code.](https://birju.dev/posts/retrieve-location-in-just-3-lines-android/)

## Features

* Android R support (Please report if any issue is found)
* Completely written in Kotlin
* Easy Initialization
* Handles Permission Model
* No Boilerplate
* Built on Kotlin DSL
* Manifest Permission Check
* Life-Cycle Aware Location Updates
* Location Settings Check
* Location Settings Request
* Custom Location Options Configuration
* Custom Rationale Dialog configuration
* Custom Permission Blocked Dialog configuration

## IMPORTANT:

### Breaking Changes from v4.0.0

> Text Customizations using `Locus.configure{}` block which were deprecated in `v3.2.0` have been now removed completely. This means `rationaleText`, `rationaleTitle`, `blockedTitle`, `blockedText`, `resolutionTitle`, and `resolutionText` no longer exist on `Locus.configure{}`. Migration would be to customize/override them from `strings.xml`.

#### Before

```kotlin
Locus.configure {
    rationaleTitle = "Rationale Title"
    rationaleTitle = "This is a rationale message."
    blockedTitle = "Permission Blocked Title"
    blockedText = "This is a permission blocked message."
    resolutionTitle = "Permission Resolution Title"
    resolutionText = "This is a permission resolution message."
}
```

#### Now

*strings.xml*

```xml

<string name="locus_rationale_title">Rationale Title</string>
<string name="locus_rationale_message">This is a rationale message.</string>
<string name="locus_permission_blocked_title">Permission Blocked Title</string>
<string name="locus_permission_blocked_message">This is a permission blocked message.</string>
<string name="locus_location_resolution_title">Permission Resolution Title</string>
<string name="locus_location_resolution_message">This is a permission resolution message.</string>
<string name="grant">Grant</string>
<string name="deny">Deny</string>
```

checkout [strings.xml](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).

### How to disable background location permission if you don't use it.

It has been brought to my attention recently that this library includes background location permission in its `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This could cause a problem when publishing app on Google Play Store in a case where your does not actually request or use background location. If that happens then this is what you need to do.

Just add this line in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file and you should be good to go.
```xml
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

Feel free to re-open [#53](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/issues/53) issue or file a new one if this does not work for you.

## Gradle Dependency

1. Add the JitPack repository.

**For Classic Android Project:**

Add this in your project's build.gradle file.

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // add this line only
    }
}
```

**For Compose Android Project:**

Add this in your project's settings.gradle file.

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // add this line only
    }
}
```

2. Add the dependency in your app's build.gradle file

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.BirjuVachhani:locus-android:latest-version'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:latest-version'
}
```

## Usage

See [Wiki](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/locus-android/wiki) on how to get started with **Locus**.

## Background Location Permission Removal

This package adds background location permission to the manifest file regardless whether you are using it or not. If you are not requesting background location permission and you are not planning to use it in future, consider adding this line into your manifest file. This is only required when you publish your app to Google Playstore because they might reject your app because of this. See realted issue #53.

```xml
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```
